Colorduino 12C Demo

This demo consists of a sketch (firmware) for the iTead Colorduino and a sketch for the Arduino.

The Arduino sketch produces the plasma animation and sends it over the I2C bus for the Colorduino to display.

You can program your Colorduino using your Arduino as a USB -> Serial converter. See more at my blog: http://123led.wordpress.com/colorduino/


IMPORTANT!

1)
You will need to put the colorduino folder in your libraries folder. If you don't have a libraries folder you will need to create one (usually in the folder where you Arduino projects are in). Then you MUST restart the Arduino software so it picks up the library.


2)
These sketches were written on Arduino IDE version 0023. They *won't* work with version 1.0. You will need to get the older IDE from the Arduino site.
